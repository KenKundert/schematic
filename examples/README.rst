Examples
========

Charge Pump
-----------

This example has a transparent background and so all wires terminate at 
terminals rather than passing underneath components. The labels are intended to 
be rendered by Latex.

Inverter
--------

NOT YET UPDATED TO VERSION 0.7.

This example uses absolute coordinates created by *offsets_to_coordinates*. It 
has a transparent background and so all wires terminate at terminals rather than 
passing underneath components. The labels are intended to be rendered by Latex.

Oscillator
----------

NOT YET UPDATED TO VERSION 0.7.

This example uses absolute coordinates created by *offsets_to_coordinates*. It 
has a transparent background and so all wires terminate at terminals rather than 
passing underneath components. The labels are intended to be rendered by Latex.

Pipelined ADC
-------------

NOT YET UPDATED TO VERSION 0.7.

This example uses absolute coordinates created by *offsets_to_coordinates*. It 
has a white background and so could route wires under components rather than 
wiring to terminals, but it largely does not.

Receiver
--------

NOT YET UPDATED TO VERSION 0.7.

This example uses relative coordinates. The only absolute coordinates given are 
for the input, and that is specified as the origin. It has a white background 
and so could route the wires underneath the components, but does not.
